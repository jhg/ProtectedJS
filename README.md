# ProtectedJS
Support for protected JS files

## Main use
It works mainly with Node.js modules, for example to obfuscate JS code of Electron.js applications.

It was not tested for browser or other targets. It depends on Node.js modules (and other dependencies but to obfuscate only) to decrypt and load code as module.
